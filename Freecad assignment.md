### PROCEDURE:-

Sure, here's a basic overview of how to use FreeCAD:

Install FreeCAD: Start by downloading and installing FreeCAD from their official website.

Open FreeCAD: Launch the application.

Create a New Document: Start by creating a new document where you'll design your object.

Workbench Selection: FreeCAD offers different workbenches for different tasks like Part Design, Draft, Sketcher, etc. Choose the appropriate workbench for your project.

Sketching: If you're using the Part Design workbench, start by sketching the 2D outline of your object on one of the available planes (XY, XZ, or YZ).

Extrusion/Revolution: Once you've sketched your object, you can extrude or revolve the sketch to give it volume.

Additional Features: You can add more features like fillets, chamfers, holes, etc., to your model to refine it further.

Assembly: If your project involves multiple parts, you can assemble them together using the Assembly workbench.

Export: Once you're satisfied with your design, you can export it in various file formats like STL, STEP, or IGES for further use or 3D printing.

Save Your Work: Don't forget to save your work regularly to avoid losing progress.

### RESULT:-

The results of using free CAD software can vary depending on factors such as the specific software chosen, the user's expertise and goals, and the complexity of the project. Here are some potential outcomes:

Cost Savings: One of the primary benefits of using free CAD software is cost savings, as users do not need to pay for expensive licenses or subscriptions. This makes it accessible to hobbyists, students, and small businesses with limited budgets.

Learning Opportunity: Free CAD software provides a valuable learning opportunity for users to develop their skills in computer-aided design without financial barriers. It allows beginners to familiarize themselves with CAD concepts and techniques before transitioning to more advanced or commercial software.

Versatility and Flexibility: Free CAD software offers a range of features and capabilities suitable for various design tasks, including 2D drafting, 3D modeling, parametric design, rendering, and simulation. Users can leverage these tools for a wide range of applications across different industries and domains.

Community Support: Many free CAD software packages benefit from active and supportive user communities, where users can seek help, share knowledge and resources, and collaborate on projects. This can enhance the user experience and provide valuable support for troubleshooting and learning.

Limitations: However, free CAD software may have limitations compared to commercial alternatives, such as fewer advanced features, less comprehensive documentation and support, and potential compatibility issues with proprietary file formats or industry standards. Users may encounter challenges when working on complex or specialized projects that require specific functionalities not available in free software.
