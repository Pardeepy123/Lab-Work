# Introduction to LibraCAD software 
### Objective :- 
The main objective of LibreCAD is to provide users with a free and open-source platform for creating accurate 2D CAD drawings. It aims to offer professional-grade functionality for tasks such as architectural drafting, mechanical design, electrical schematics, and more, without the need for expensive proprietary software. LibreCAD strives to be user-friendly, customizable, and compatible with industry-standard file formats, making it accessible to a wide range of users for various design and drafting projects.
### Introduction:-
LibreCAD is a free and open-source 2D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software. It's designed for creating technical drawings, floor plans, schematics, and diagrams. It offers features like layers, blocks, and customizable tool palettes. It's a great tool for architects, engineers, and hobbyists who need to create precise drawings. It has a great significance as it create a strong base for the advanced software like [AutoCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD),[Sketchup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SketchUp),[Freecad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD),[Microstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstation)
